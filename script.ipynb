      "Looking ahead, we have seen in the last 15-20 days, we have seen some uptick in demand in \n",

      "from Aniket Kulkarni from BMSPL Capital. Please go ahead. \n",
      "Aniket Kulkarni: Good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity. I had a couple of questions. Is there a \n",
      "slowdown in the China economy affecting the company's operations in any way? Either a \n",
      "direct effect or a spill-down effect if you can explain? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Thank you for the question. Yes, definitely. The Chinese market has been one of the key \n",
      "markets for our exports historically. Not specifically for our company, but for our country it \n",
      "has been the key market. And the slowdown has affected, but lately we have seen in the last 2-\n",
      "3 months, last one month we have seen some uptake in the demand from China as well. \n",
      "I think the biggest impact from China has been in the synthetic yarn market rather than cotton \n",
      "yarn market. So there is some down effect, but it is more pronounced in synthetic yarn than in \n",
      "cotton and cotton-blended yarns. \n",
      "Aniket Kulkarni: Okay. I have a couple of other macro related questions also. Does the company benefit in any \n",
      "way if textile capacities are shut down in Bangladesh due to the recent labour unrest which \n",
      "was going on? Does this benefit the company or it harms us? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So I think the recent reports of the slowdown or shutdown in Bangladesh was misreported. For \n",
      "us, Bangladesh is a very key market. Almost 60% of our exports to Bangladesh and it \n",
      "definitely hurts us more than it benefits if there is some disruption in Bangladesh. \n",
      "But we have not seen anything of that sort. Of course there was a slowdown in purchases from \n",
      "Bangladesh vendors, because of the impending election and because of the fear of some \n",
      "sanctions. There were rumours of sanctions being imposed by US and EU which has since not \n",
      "happened and the business is back to normal since then. \n",
      "There were elections on 7th January and from 15th January they are back. They were not \n",
      "buying for a month, not that aggressively, but I think they are back on the table now. Things \n",
      "are back to normal. \n",
      "Aniket Kulkarni: Okay. Do we stand to benefit from the UK free trade agreement, if it materializes, because the \n",
      "textile duties are expected to come down? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Most definitely. UK doesn't import any yarns, but of course the Indian garment sector will \n",
      "benefit hugely and in turn we being a key supplier to those vendors, definitely it will be a big \n",
      "boost in the longer term. In short term it will be good for confidence. But in longer term UK \n",
      "can be a big market for garment exporters from India. So definitely it will be a huge benefit for \n",
      "us in the long term. \n",
      "Aniket Kulkarni: One last question on capacity. If you operate at full capacity including the new ones which \n",
      "have come, what kind of revenues can you achieve?          Sportking India Limited \n",

      "Munish Avasthi: So we are fully right now, I think this is the top. So we are looking at revenue of anything \n",
      "between INR2400 crores to INR2500 crores for the full year at this capacity. So we are \n",
      "working at almost the full capacity. So this is going to be at these prices of yarn, this is going \n",
      "to be our run rate for the time being. About INR600 crores plus minus 5% for every quarter. \n",
      "Aniket Kulkarni: Okay, understood. Thank you so much for answering my questions and best of luck for the \n",

      "proceed. \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Hi sir. Happy New Year and thank you for the opportunity. So what's your sense to cotton \n",
      "prices? It seems like the cotton prices have pretty much cooled down to around INR55,000 per \n",
      "candy. What's your take on it? And what is the valuation of inventory that you have of cotton \n",
      "that you have at your end? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: I didn't get your question. The second of course, I didn't get your question. What are you \n",
      "wanting to know? \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Okay, so it seems like cotton prices have cooled down to around INR55,000 per candy. So \n",
      "how is it going at cotton? And what valuation is the inventory holding of cotton? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Okay, so the cotton prices are right now oscillating between INR54,000 and INR55,000. They \n",
      "have been here for almost a month now. And as I said in my opening remark, these are the \n",
      "lowest prices in relation to international prices for long, maybe three, four years. So, we \n",
      "definitely feel there's a lot of value in cotton right now. And this is generally the harvest \n",
      "period. So the arrivals are at their peak. \n",
      "So this is generally the time and most of the mills, they stock up. So we are also doing that. \n",
      "About the exact amount of cotton stock, we don't share that number. So right now, I can just \n",
      "tell you that the arrivals are at their peak. So this is the time we generally stock up. And we \n",
      "feel this is the right time. In relation to international prices, prices are at the lower end. \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Okay, so it shouldn't fall from your end for the right, like, ideally? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: I don't have a crystal ball, but yeah, we feel it's pretty much at the bottom. \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Right. So what is the cotton yarn spread this quarter? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So cotton yarn spread was around about INR121. \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Okay, INR121. And it seems like on quarter-on-quarter basis, your margins, your EBITDA \n",
      "margins are lower. Is there any particular reason for it? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: EBITDA margins were a little higher actually, quarter-to-quarters, by 2%, I think. Not lower. \n",
      "If you exclude the other income, they were slightly higher, by 2%.          Sportking India Limited \n",

      "Darshit: Yeah. Hello. Am I audible? \n",
      "Moderator: Yes, you are. \n",
      "Darshit: Yeah. So thank you for taking my question. So my first question is, why have the margins \n",
      "dipped so significantly like going from 13% to say 8%? If I'm saying, okay, what would be the \n",
      "reason for that? And if in case, like, if you're saying that the prices have hit rock bottom, and \n",
      "if, say, suppose the margins improve from here, by what, like, within what timeline would we \n",
      "go back to the long term 11%, 12% EBITDA margins? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So, margins have been pretty subdued for the last three, four quarters. So it's not some \n",
      "phenomenon has not happened like now. So margins have been, in the range of 10% to 8% for \n",
      "the last four quarters now. And there are many reasons behind it. First of all, of course, all the \n",
      "huge slump in demand across the world, the Western markets, bring their stock, \n",
      "rationalization, many other factors. But now, getting back to the normal levels, which were \n",
      "12% to 13% for us, I see some roadmap, going towards it. \n",
      " I believe we should be getting into, it's not in a very distant future. We see some, something \n",
      "which we haven't seen for the last four quarters, that is very low prices and good demand. So I \n",
      "believe that in two, three months, we should start seeing some uptick in margins also and \n",
      "getting, inching towards the normalcy. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. But like any, any kind of like very ballpark timeline, say a year or two, you go \n",
      "back to these margins, 11, 12? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: I think if all it, it looks like that it might happen, in three to four months. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. Great. That's great. And secondly, do we have any capex plans going forward? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Not as of now. We don't have any major capex plans, just normal upgradation, modernization, \n",
      "that's it. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. And debt scenario? The debt will remain or are we planning to repay back? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: We are continuously repaying our long-term debt. So the debt, which had peaked at around \n",
      "INR430 crores, so it is down to INR380 crores now. So we'll be paying, paying it as it comes \n",
      "due. So we are in no hurry to repay it. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. Great. And, and finally, just last question, any kind of, not specifically guidance, \n",
      "but overview over the next, say two years, what do you think, the revenues might go to? \n",
      "Margins you talked about it but what you think about the revenues? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So, as I told you, like for next one year – eighteen months, for at least next one year, we expect \n",
      "the revenues between 2400 plus minus 5%, because we are not adding any capacity in next one          Sportking India Limited \n",
      "  January 23, 2024 \n",
      " \n",
      "Page 7 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "year. And that's, and they will definitely be in that ballpark. If the prices go up, yeah, they can \n",
      "go up by 10%, 7%, 8%, how the prices move. But the quantity wise, we are, so we will be \n",
      "sticking to this quantity for next 12 months at least. As we are not adding anything more. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. So like we're running at peak capacities and we won't be doing capex. So it will be in \n",
      "that range. \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Yeah, exactly. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. So we are relying on realization to improve and then we'll probably think on \n",
      "doing capex? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Yes. Yes. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Great. \n",
      "Moderator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Keshav Garg from Counter Cyclical PMS. Please \n",
      "go ahead. \n",
      "Keshav Garg: Sir, I'm trying to understand that on our 25-megawatt rooftop solar power plant that we have \n",
      "set up, sir, what was the capex that we have incurred and what is the expected IRR on this? \n",
      "And sir, our quarterly power and fuel cost is around INR40 crores. So by how much will it \n",
      "come down going forward due to this? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So our total outlay was around INR85, about INR85 crores on this 25-megawatt. And the IRR, \n",
      "I think my team can get back to you separately. We don't have the numbers offhand. And we \n",
      "will be saving almost, you can say, around 1 lakh. So our cost, which is, see, some major \n",
      "portion of this was operationalized in the last six months also. So the saving, what we are from \n",
      "where we were, the saving is almost about... \n",
      "Keshav Garg: Also, I wanted to understand that… \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Cross INR4 crores a quarter. About INR4 crores a quarter. But it goes up in the summer \n",
      "months and it comes down in the winter months. \n",
      "Keshav Garg: Great, sir. Sir, I am trying to understand that we have capability to manufacture cotton yarn as \n",
      "well as blended and synthetic yarn from our facilities. So I am trying to understand that how \n",
      "fungible is our capacity that depending upon the realization and spread in different segments, \n",
      "can we, by what extent can we basically alter our output from cotton yarn to, let's say, blended \n",
      "or synthetic yarn? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So synthetic yarn, once you have cotton yarn spindles, you can spin anything on them. It is \n",
      "very difficult going from polyester to cotton. It is rather impossible. You have to incur a lot of \n",
      "capex. But going from cotton yarn to synthetic yarn is not that difficult. So I think  we don't do \n",

      "direct effect or a spill-down effect if you can explain? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Thank you for the question. Yes, definitely. The Chinese market has been one of the key \n",
      "markets for our exports historically. Not specifically for our company, but for our country it \n",
      "has been the key market. And the slowdown has affected, but lately we have seen in the last 2-\n",
      "3 months, last one month we have seen some uptake in the demand from China as well. \n",
      "I think the biggest impact from China has been in the synthetic yarn market rather than cotton \n",
      "yarn market. So there is some down effect, but it is more pronounced in synthetic yarn than in \n",
      "cotton and cotton-blended yarns. \n",
      "Aniket Kulkarni: Okay. I have a couple of other macro related questions also. Does the company benefit in any \n",
      "way if textile capacities are shut down in Bangladesh due to the recent labour unrest which \n",
      "was going on? Does this benefit the company or it harms us? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So I think the recent reports of the slowdown or shutdown in Bangladesh was misreported. For \n",
      "us, Bangladesh is a very key market. Almost 60% of our exports to Bangladesh and it \n",
      "definitely hurts us more than it benefits if there is some disruption in Bangladesh. \n",
      "But we have not seen anything of that sort. Of course there was a slowdown in purchases from \n",
      "Bangladesh vendors, because of the impending election and because of the fear of some \n",
      "sanctions. There were rumours of sanctions being imposed by US and EU which has since not \n",
      "happened and the business is back to normal since then. \n",
      "There were elections on 7th January and from 15th January they are back. They were not \n",
      "buying for a month, not that aggressively, but I think they are back on the table now. Things \n",
      "are back to normal. \n",
      "Aniket Kulkarni: Okay. Do we stand to benefit from the UK free trade agreement, if it materializes, because the \n",
      "textile duties are expected to come down? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Most definitely. UK doesn't import any yarns, but of course the Indian garment sector will \n",
      "benefit hugely and in turn we being a key supplier to those vendors, definitely it will be a big \n",
      "boost in the longer term. In short term it will be good for confidence. But in longer term UK \n",
      "can be a big market for garment exporters from India. So definitely it will be a huge benefit for \n",
      "us in the long term. \n",

      "candy. What's your take on it? And what is the valuation of inventory that you have of cotton \n",
      "that you have at your end? \n",

      "how is it going at cotton? And what valuation is the inventory holding of cotton? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Okay, so the cotton prices are right now oscillating between INR54,000 and INR55,000. They \n",
      "have been here for almost a month now. And as I said in my opening remark, these are the \n",
      "lowest prices in relation to international prices for long, maybe three, four years. So, we \n",
      "definitely feel there's a lot of value in cotton right now. And this is generally the harvest \n",
      "period. So the arrivals are at their peak. \n",
      "So this is generally the time and most of the mills, they stock up. So we are also doing that. \n",
      "About the exact amount of cotton stock, we don't share that number. So right now, I can just \n",
      "tell you that the arrivals are at their peak. So this is the time we generally stock up. And we \n",
      "feel this is the right time. In relation to international prices, prices are at the lower end. \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Okay, so it shouldn't fall from your end for the right, like, ideally? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: I don't have a crystal ball, but yeah, we feel it's pretty much at the bottom. \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Right. So what is the cotton yarn spread this quarter? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So cotton yarn spread was around about INR121. \n",
      "Varun Gajaria: Okay, INR121. And it seems like on quarter-on-quarter basis, your margins, your EBITDA \n",
      "margins are lower. Is there any particular reason for it? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: EBITDA margins were a little higher actually, quarter-to-quarters, by 2%, I think. Not lower. \n",

      "Moderator: Yes, you are. \n",
      "Darshit: Yeah. So thank you for taking my question. So my first question is, why have the margins \n",
      "dipped so significantly like going from 13% to say 8%? If I'm saying, okay, what would be the \n",
      "reason for that? And if in case, like, if you're saying that the prices have hit rock bottom, and \n",
      "if, say, suppose the margins improve from here, by what, like, within what timeline would we \n",
      "go back to the long term 11%, 12% EBITDA margins? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So, margins have been pretty subdued for the last three, four quarters. So it's not some \n",
      "phenomenon has not happened like now. So margins have been, in the range of 10% to 8% for \n",
      "the last four quarters now. And there are many reasons behind it. First of all, of course, all the \n",
      "huge slump in demand across the world, the Western markets, bring their stock, \n",
      "rationalization, many other factors. But now, getting back to the normal levels, which were \n",
      "12% to 13% for us, I see some roadmap, going towards it. \n",
      " I believe we should be getting into, it's not in a very distant future. We see some, something \n",
      "which we haven't seen for the last four quarters, that is very low prices and good demand. So I \n",
      "believe that in two, three months, we should start seeing some uptick in margins also and \n",
      "getting, inching towards the normalcy. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. But like any, any kind of like very ballpark timeline, say a year or two, you go \n",
      "back to these margins, 11, 12? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: I think if all it, it looks like that it might happen, in three to four months. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. Great. That's great. And secondly, do we have any capex plans going forward? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Not as of now. We don't have any major capex plans, just normal upgradation, modernization, \n",
      "that's it. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. And debt scenario? The debt will remain or are we planning to repay back? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: We are continuously repaying our long-term debt. So the debt, which had peaked at around \n",
      "INR430 crores, so it is down to INR380 crores now. So we'll be paying, paying it as it comes \n",
      "due. So we are in no hurry to repay it. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. Great. And, and finally, just last question, any kind of, not specifically guidance, \n",
      "but overview over the next, say two years, what do you think, the revenues might go to? \n",
      "Margins you talked about it but what you think about the revenues? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So, as I told you, like for next one year – eighteen months, for at least next one year, we expect \n",
      "the revenues between 2400 plus minus 5%, because we are not adding any capacity in next one          Sportking India Limited \n",

      " \n",
      "Page 7 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "year. And that's, and they will definitely be in that ballpark. If the prices go up, yeah, they can \n",
      "go up by 10%, 7%, 8%, how the prices move. But the quantity wise, we are, so we will be \n",
      "sticking to this quantity for next 12 months at least. As we are not adding anything more. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. So like we're running at peak capacities and we won't be doing capex. So it will be in \n",
      "that range. \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: Yeah, exactly. \n",
      "Darshit: Okay. Okay. So we are relying on realization to improve and then we'll probably think on \n",
      "doing capex? \n",

      "And sir, our quarterly power and fuel cost is around INR40 crores. So by how much will it \n",
      "come down going forward due to this? \n",
      "Munish Avasthi: So our total outlay was around INR85, about INR85 crores on this 25-megawatt. And the IRR, \n",
      "I think my team can get back to you separately. We don't have the numbers offhand. And we \n",
      "will be saving almost, you can say, around 1 lakh. So our cost, which is, see, some major \n",
